# Pinpin assets

`policy.json` assigns explicit production and archive roles. `manifest.json` records
each asset's relative path, role, byte count, SHA-256, and immutable object path.
Source code, source/provenance notes, generation records, and policy stay in Git.
Production assets also stay in Git so the production build and deployed reader
make no Hugging Face requests. Experimental, historical, model, and review assets
are archived in the public HF bucket `miguelemosreverte/mr-pinpin-archive` after
verification. Public visibility was explicitly approved and enabled by the main
operator on 2026-09-22, resolving the earlier private-storage quota blocker.

The main operator uploaded 181 manifest assets from the mini and is completing
fresh remote verification. Migration is not complete until the verified receipt
is available and applied; this catalog
alone is not proof. The planned receipt is
`/Volumes/TB4/mac-mini-storage/shared/pinpin-asset-cache/mini-upload-receipt.json`.
Local assets remain in place. Authoring Blender sources are being preserved
independently under `authoring/blender-v3`; see
`tools/assets/verification-authoring.md` for their separate verification status.

## Plan and sync

```sh
npm run assets:plan
npm run assets:sync -- --dry-run
npm run assets:sync
```

Refresh the catalog after adding media or changing story registries. Supported
binary files under `docs` default to archive unless explicitly selected by policy
or referenced by a configured production registry. Original-book assets and
registered stories, covers, sprites, and video variants remain production.
Direct HTML/CSS/JS references need a policy entry; computed paths require review.
New file extensions or registry types need explicit policy support. The Pages
builder checks the catalog but does not refresh it automatically.

Normal sync runs `node tools/assets/catalog.cjs --root ROOT`, then invokes
`tools/assets/hf_store.py push --manifest assets/manifest.json --root ROOT
--cache CACHE --profile archive --receipt RECEIPT`. It uses `PINPIN_PYTHON`
(default `python3`). Install the adapter dependencies from
`tools/assets/requirements.txt` into your Python environment before uploading.
Dry run builds the catalog in memory and reports proposed changes without uploads,
generated-file writes, index changes, or `.gitignore` changes.

Only a version 1 `push` or `verify` receipt with `verified: true`,
`dry_run: false`, and the exact bucket permits migration. Every archive entry
must match its path, role, byte count, SHA-256, and content object key, with both
`verified: true` and `remote_verified: true`. Omitted proof fields are refused.
Sync rehashes present local archive files after remote verification, updates its
managed `.gitignore` block with anchored, escaped exact paths, and runs
`git rm --cached` for verified indexed archive paths. Working files remain on disk,
including staged modifications that match the uploaded manifest. Indexed file
bytes must also match the receipt; a different staged version stops sync. Managed
symlinks must match their staged link targets. Missing local
archive files are allowed when the receipt proves their manifest identities.
Changes since upload stop the operation before Git changes. Content outside the
managed ignore block is preserved. Sync never commits, pushes Git, deletes local
assets, or rewrites Git history; old Git blobs remain in historical commits.

Policy-listed source symlinks may be read and hash-checked for upload and local
verification. A directory symlink such as
`docs/storyboard/models/pinpin-v3/renders` is ignored and removed from the index
only when every manifest child is archive and every file currently beneath it is
accounted for as archive. Unknown files or production children keep that parent
symlink tracked. Arbitrary symlinks are refused. Restore does not write through
symlink destinations.

The adapter's explicit `push --allow-source-symlinks` flag permits source reads
through links without interpreting policy; sync checks the policy allowlist before
using it. The flag is rejected for pull and verify, so it cannot enable writes
through restore destinations.

## Cache and mini upload

Set `PINPIN_ASSET_CACHE` outside the checkout. The default is
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/mr-pinpin/assets`; `--cache CACHE` overrides it.
Use the mini's SSD for large transfers:

```sh
export PINPIN_ASSET_CACHE=/Volumes/TB4/mac-mini-storage/shared/pinpin-asset-cache
```

The primary operator can upload a regular-file staging root on the mini using the
same manifest, then apply its receipt to the local checkout:

```sh
"${PINPIN_PYTHON:-python3}" tools/assets/hf_store.py push \
  --manifest assets/manifest.json --root /path/to/regular-file-stage \
  --cache "$PINPIN_ASSET_CACHE" --profile archive \
  --receipt "$PINPIN_ASSET_CACHE/mini-upload-receipt.json"
npm run assets:sync -- --apply-receipt /path/to/mini-upload-receipt.json --dry-run
npm run assets:sync -- --apply-receipt /path/to/mini-upload-receipt.json
```

Receipt application skips catalog generation and upload. Keep the matching
manifest available locally. Receipts contain hashes and verification records,
not credentials; they are trusted operator artifacts, not signed attestations.
An incomplete, mismatched, duplicate, dry-run, or unverified receipt is refused.
Sync-generated receipts live in the external cache.

For interrupted direct uploads, reuse `--receipt FILE` or supply
`--resume-receipt FILE`. Matching prior remote proofs may skip repeat downloads
only when bucket, path, role, bytes, SHA-256, object key, and remote Xet identity
still match. `--workers N` sets transfer verification concurrency from 1 to 16
(default 4). New or changed remote objects require a fresh download and hash check.

## Restore and verification

```sh
npm run assets:pull
npm run assets:verify -- --receipt /path/outside/repo/archive-verified.json
```

Pull restores missing archive files using the local cache or HF and verifies
their byte counts and SHA-256. Existing conflicting files are not overwritten.
To restore into a separate regular directory, invoke the adapter directly:

```sh
"${PINPIN_PYTHON:-python3}" tools/assets/hf_store.py pull \
  --manifest assets/manifest.json --root /path/to/restore \
  --cache "$PINPIN_ASSET_CACHE" --profile archive
```

Objects use `sha256/<first-two-hex>/<sha256>/<basename>`. New content gets a new
object path. Upload receipts require remote content verification; matching size
alone is insufficient. Configure authentication using the standard HF credential
store or `HF_TOKEN` in the operator environment. Never put credentials in the
repository, browser code, receipts, or logs. Production builds require no HF token.
